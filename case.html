            <h3>What I Did</h3>
            <p>For the most part my group and I all conducted research to explore the reasons why people are reluctant to adopt reptiles and other small animals. In addition, a competitor analysis was used to determine the opportunities the organization could consider improving on in comparison to other organizations. 
            I created a survey with my group and sent out the surveys onto different forums to see what people think when adopting a reptile or small animal. We found that some people struggle with adopting reptiles as pets due to lack of education both from the adopter to their families, in addition to issues involving finances and lack of physical space in their home. The organization can consider using images of the pets available for adoption and organize data and resources to be easily found by the user.</p>

        <h3>User Research & Findings</h3>
        <p class="userResearch">Usability testing was simple and directed at making sure visitors to the mobile and the desktop websites were able to easily find the Adopt option. We all conducted low and high fidelity test on our users. While the first prototype had more feedback from my end, being the setup and how the information was laid out. They were able to do their tasks easily. For high fidelity, my users had no issue finding anything and found the color very eye catching and not too distracting.</p>
